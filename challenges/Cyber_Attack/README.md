# Cyber_Attack
*Welcome, Brave Hero of Eldoria. You’ve entered a domain controlled by the forces of Malakar, the Dark Ruler of Eldoria. This is no place for the faint of heart. Proceed with caution: The systems here are heavily guarded, and one misstep could alert Malakar’s sentinels. But if you’re brave—or foolish—enough to exploit these defenses, you might just find a way to weaken his hold on this world. Choose your path carefully: Your actions here could bring hope to Eldoria… or doom us all. The shadows are watching. Make your move.*
