# Cave_Expedition
*Rumors of a black drake terrorizing the fields of Dunlorn have spread far and wide. The village has offered a hefty bounty for its defeat. Sir Alaric and Thorin answered the call also returning with treasures from its lair. Among the retrieved items they found a map. Unfortunately it cannot be used directly because a custom encryption algorithm was probably used. Luckily it was possible to retrieve the original code that managed the encryption process. Can you investigate about what happened and retrieve the map content?*
